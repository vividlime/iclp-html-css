												<h2>REPORT: 5 CRITICAL WAYS TO INCREASE SHOPPER ENGAGEMENT AND SALES</h2>
												<p>With shopper expections evolving with the world's of retail and technology, it is no surprise that many retailers struggle to keep pace and give customers compelling reasons that make them want to engage, spend more and become loyal advocates. Without understanding who their customers are and how to make them feel more valued and rewarded, retailers cannot connect in a more emotional way that deepens their personal association and encourages them to share more of their experiences.</p>
<p>The key to shopper engagement and ultimately capturing their loyalty is to understand the stage of each customer in their individual journey and provide the tools, channels and experiences that take shoppers from one stage to the next. Our report explores how to meet these expectations while driving engagement and positively impacting commercial performance.</p>

												<h2>REPORT: SECURING THE LOYALTY OF OMNICHANNEL CUSTOMERS</h2>
												<p>Omnichannel strategies are being developed and delivered to respond to continual changes in individual shopper behaviour. The path to purchase is no longer linear - it has been disrupted by consumer adoption of new technology and its use, enabling greater peer influence in browsing and buying behaviour.</p>
<p>Delivering a true omnichannel strategy creates a brand relevant, seamless customer experience across all paths to purchase that is commercially optimised to improve business performance. Connecting data across all digital, social and offline touchpoints at individual shopper level throughout the journey and being able to apply intelligent customer management rules will further move retailers along their omnichannel journey towards seamless delivery.</p>
<p>This report explores the potential for securing the loyalty and devotion of omnichannel customers, whilst realising the commercial opportunities for brand differentiation, business growth and profitability.</p>
