			 					<h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
			 					<ul>
			 						<li>GHA was challenged with developing a programme structure that went beyond traditional tier-based recognition benefits and conventional rewards. The introduction of 'Local Experiences' provided members with a range of unforgettable experiences inspired by individual destinations, all designed to recognise and reward members for desired programme behaviour.</li>

									<li>The loyalty programme had to extend across all of GHA's properties, encompassing 14 individual brands with their own business needs, internal systems, operational processes and support teams.
									As some of GHA's member brands are less well-known than others, particularly between different regions, the programme also needed to raise awareness and promote cross-selling between brands without cannibalisation.</li>

									<li>Liaison with hotel staff to create buy-in, commitment to implementation and quality of delivery was critical to the programme's success; ensuring the program reflected the same level of individual service and exclusivity that a guest would expect to receive in a GHA brand hotel.
									Today, the GHA Discovery programme features close to 1,000 Local Experiences which members can browse online and then redeem at a GHA hotel brand and location. These 'Local Experiences' have to be truly unique and authentic, off the beaten track and not usually available as part of normal tourist activities.</li>

			 					<h2>DELIVERABLES</h2>
			 					<ul>
			 						<li>ICLP created a communication and supporting data management strategy that enabled GHA to develop a sophisticated programme and member lifecycle communications plan to drive customer engagement within the programme.</li>

									<li>Using complex data analytics techniques and trigger communications, ICLP implemented a customised messaging framework that dynamically segments communication content according to hotel brand, member tier, language, membership lifecycle stage and historical programme activity.</li>

									<li>The above technique enabled the delivery of highly individualised member communications; ensured that members receive timely and relevant information regarding programme benefits, local experience awards and promotional offers that reflect their personal profile and behaviour.</li>

									<li>ICLP also provided the creative design and execution of GHA Discovery membership/programme collateral, messaging content configuration, email broadcasting, print production and global member pack fulfillment from three regionalised ICLP fulfillment hubs.

			 					<h2>RESULTS</h2>
			 					<p>GHA Discovery is able to personalise communications to members based on programme and stay activity, as well as language preference.
								Over 1.6 million members joined within 9 months of programme launch.
								GHA Discovery is currently growing by nearly 2,200 members every day.</p>
