	 						<li><a href="">GHA was challenged with</a> developing a programme structure that went beyond traditional tier-based recognition benefits and conventional rewards. The introduction of 'Local Experiences' provided members with a range of unforgettable experiences inspired by individual destinations, all designed to recognise and reward members for desired programme behaviour.</li>

							<li>The loyalty programme had to extend across all of GHA's properties, encompassing 14 individual brands with their own business needs, internal systems, operational processes and support teams.
							As some of GHA's member brands are less well-known than others, particularly between different regions, the programme also needed to raise awareness and promote cross-selling between brands without cannibalisation.</li>

							<li>Liaison with hotel staff to create buy-in, commitment to implementation and quality of delivery was critical to the programme's success; ensuring the program reflected the same level of individual service and exclusivity that a guest would expect to receive in a GHA brand hotel.
							Today, the GHA Discovery programme features close to 1,000 Local Experiences which members can browse online and then redeem at a GHA hotel brand and location. These 'Local Experiences' have to be truly unique and authentic, off the beaten track and not usually available as part of normal tourist activities.</li>
